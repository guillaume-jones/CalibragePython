## Getting started (on local station)

#### 1) You will need to [install miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) in order to set-up your python environment.

#### 2) Once miniconda is installed and the repository is cloned, run the following commands in order to create your virtual environment and start the jupyter notebook:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml # Only do it once in order to create the environment (might take a few minutes)

# Start the jupyter notebooks:
conda activate env-gbm8378  # Do it everytime you wish to run the notebook
jupyter notebook  
```
